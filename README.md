# Exploratory Data Analysis

## Bronx Data Analysis
The Bronx Data Analysis project aims to provide a comprehensive exploration of various datasets related to the Bronx borough. Using data visualization and statistical techniques, this analysis delves into demographic information, housing trends, education statistics, crime rates, and more. The objective is to gain valuable insights into the Bronx community, identify patterns, and highlight areas for improvement. By presenting this analysis, we hope to contribute to a better understanding of the Bronx and support evidence-based decision-making for social and urban development.

## Income Data Analysis
The Income Data Analysis project focuses on exploring diverse datasets related to income and earnings. Through exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques, we aim to uncover patterns and trends in income distributions, factors influencing earnings, income disparities across different demographics, and regional variations. This analysis provides valuable insights into the economic landscape, aids in understanding income inequality, and serves as a basis for potential policy and economic interventions.
