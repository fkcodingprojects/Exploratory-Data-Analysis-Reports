# Exploratory Data Analysis: Income Classification Dataset

This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) project focusing on analyzing and visualizing data related to income classification using the Python programming language. The dataset used for this analysis is the 'income_evaluation.csv' file.

## Data Source

The data used in this analysis is sourced from the 'income_evaluation.csv' file, which contains information related to income classification. It includes features such as age, education level, workclass, and hours per week, along with the income class (<=50K or >50K).

## Overview of Analysis

1. **Distribution of Age:** The analysis begins by visualizing the distribution of ages in the dataset using a histogram. This provides insights into the age distribution of the individuals in the dataset.

2. **Income Classes Distribution - Pie Chart:** Next, a pie chart is created to illustrate the distribution of income classes in the dataset. It presents the percentage of individuals falling into different income categories (<=50K and >50K).

3. **Distribution of Education Levels - Bar Plot:** The analysis generates a bar plot to show the count of individuals with different education levels. This visualization provides insights into the educational background of the individuals in the dataset.

4. **Age Distribution by Income - Box Plot:** A box plot is created to visualize the distribution of ages for two income classes: <=50K and >50K. This plot allows us to compare the age distribution between these income groups.

5. **Distribution of Workclass - Bar Plot:** The analysis generates a bar plot to show the count of individuals in different workclasses. This visualization provides insights into the distribution of different work types in the dataset.

6. **Relationship between Age, Hours per Week, and Income - Scatter Plot:** Finally, a scatter plot is created to visualize the relationship between age, hours per week, and income. This plot helps identify any potential patterns or trends between these variables.

## How to Run the Analysis

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Install the required libraries: pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn (for scatter plot).
3. Replace 'income_evaluation.csv' with the actual path to your dataset CSV file.
4. Run the Python script, and it will generate visualizations for age distribution, income classes distribution, education level distribution, age distribution by income, workclass distribution, and a scatter plot showing the relationship between age, hours per week, and income.

Feel free to modify the code and adapt it to your specific needs.
